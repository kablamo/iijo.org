iijo.org
=======

[iijo.org](http://iijo.org) is a little site I built to easily create and
review Chinese flashcards.  The 2 stand out features of this site are the fact
it uses [spaced repetition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) and
the ability to create flashcards from a dictionary of words.  I'm not sure if these
are still rare features but when I started on this project in 2008 they were.

People sometimes tell me its not using spaced repititon because the UI is not what
they are used to from Anki, but it if you check the source code you will see
that it is.  I feel this UI is simpler and easier to use.

I would love to receive code contributions.

iijo.org/dictionary
===================

[iijo.org](http://iijo.org/dictionary) is almost a separate website.  Its a
searchable Chinese/English dictionary.  The goal is to provide a dictionary
that allows you to quickly add a new flashcard to your list of cards to learn.
